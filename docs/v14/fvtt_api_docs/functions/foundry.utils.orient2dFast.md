# Function orient2dFast

* orient2dFast(a: Point, b: Point, c: Point): number

  Determine the relative orientation of three points in two-dimensional space.
  The result is also an approximation of twice the signed area of the triangle defined by the three points.
  This method is fast - but not robust against issues of floating point precision. Best used with integer coordinates.

  #### Parameters

  + a: Point

    An endpoint of segment AB, relative to which point C is tested
  + b: Point

    An endpoint of segment AB, relative to which point C is tested
  + c: Point

    A point that is tested relative to segment AB

  #### Returns number

  The relative orientation of points A, B, and C
  A positive value if the points are in counter-clockwise order (C lies to the left of AB)
  A negative value if the points are in clockwise order (C lies to the right of AB)
  Zero if the points A, B, and C are collinear.
