## Learning Management
- Whenever requested to "learn", "register learning", or "remember something":
  1. Create a new markdown file in the `learnings/` directory relative to the repository root.
  2. Name the file descriptively based on the context (e.g., `feature-xyz-implementation.md` or `bug-abc-resolution.md`).
  3. Document the Problem, Cause, Solution, and Context clearly.
  4. Use Portuguese (pt-BR) or English (en-US) consistent with the request language.
